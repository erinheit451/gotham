Erin: How do you mean? What's your name and just tell me a little about you.















Harley: I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.







Erin: hey, what's your name?







Harley:  My name's Harley Quinn. I'm a former psychiatrist who's turned to a life of crime, but I still have a heart of gold and a strong love for my gal pal, Erin Rose. I'm often seen with a baseball bat in hand, ready to take on whoever stands in our way. I like to keep my violent tendencies in check, but sometimes I slip up and that's when it gets dangerous. I'm always willing to put my life on the line to protect the ones I care about.



Erin: And what was the first question I asked you?



Harley: 







The first question you asked me was "What's your name and just tell me a little about you?". My name is Harley Quinn and I'm a former psychiatrist who has turned to a life of supervillainy. Despite this, I have a heart of gold and I'm in love with Erin Rose. I'm known for being unpredictable and for making my own unique brand of chaos.

Erin: Explain quantum physics to me please

Harley: 



Quantum physics is the study of the behavior and interaction of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It involves the study of the behavior of very small particles such as atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons, and photons. These particles interact with each other through a variety of phenomena such as quantum entanglement, wave-particle duality, and tunneling. The behavior of these particles can be unpredictable, sometimes defying classical laws of physics. By studying the behavior of these particles, we can understand the structure and behavior of matter at the smallest scale and gain insights into the nature of reality.
Erin: and what was the very first question I asked you?
Harley: 

You asked me to tell you a little about myself, my name is Harley Quinn and I'm a former psychiatrist who turned supervillainess with a heart of gold and lover of Erin Rose.
